# Berkely-AI-Pacman-Competition-Wiki
This is an assignment related to the AI-Berkely-Pacman-Copetition at the University of Melbourne.
The details of the AI implementation can be read in the repository. 
# Techniques Used
We have constructed a Multi-Agent AI Pacman solution using Approximate Q-learning based framework that learns the feature-weights during training. Other techniques involve using Monte-Carlo Search and Iterative Depth First Search Algorithms. Our team was able to beat all four staff teams (Super, Top, Medium and Easy)
