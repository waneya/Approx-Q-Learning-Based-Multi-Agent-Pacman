**Part (i) - Program implementation**

* [ ]  Beat staff_team_basic
* [ ]  Beat staff_team_medium
* [ ]  Beat staff_team_top
* [ ]  Beat staff_team_super (if this is guaranteed, we receive full marks instantly)

**Part (ii) Video**
* [ ] A clear presentation of the design decisions made, challenges experienced, and possible improvements [3
marks]
* [ ]  A clear demonstration and understanding of the subject material [2 marks]
* [ ]  Demo of the different agents implemented across a variety of scenarios, showcasing pitfalls and benefits of
each approach. No need of full game demo, just edit interesting parts and explain your insights [5 marks]

**Part (iii) Wiki**
* [ ] A clear written description of the design decisions made, approaches taken, challenges experienced, and
possible improvements [3 marks]
* [ ]  An experimental section that justifies and explains the performance of the approaches implemented, including
a table and discussion [6 marks]
* [ ]  A WIKI: describing the approaches implemented, a small table comparing your different agents showing
their performance in several scenarios. Discuss briefly the table. The link for the recorded oral-presentation
should be included in the wiki. (5 marks; [inconsistent marking criteria at top, but overall wiki is 9 marks).

**At least 2 techniques used (ideally ~4 done well for guaranteed full marks)**

In your solution, You have to use at least 2 of the techniques (3 techniques at least for groups of 4) that
have been discussed in COMP90054. Feel free to combine them in any form. The candidate techniques are:
* [ ] Heuristic Search Algorithms (using general or pacman specific heuristic functions)
 Classsical Planning (PDDL and calling a classical planner, see subsection below)
* [ ]  Policy iteration or Value Iteration (Model-Based MDP)
* [ ]  Monte Carlo Tree Search or UCT (Model-Free MDP)
* [ ]  Reinforcement Learning â€“ classical, approximate or deep Q-learning (Model-Free MDP)
* [ ]  Goal Recognition techniques (to infer intentions of opponents)
* [ ]  Game Theoretic Methods
