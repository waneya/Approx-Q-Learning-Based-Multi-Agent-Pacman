# Design Choices

## Considerations

- Design an offensive and defensive agent or generalise to a multi-agent problem?

## Techniques

1. Heuristic Search Algorithms (using general or pacman specific heuristic functions) 
2. Classsical Planning (PDDL and calling a classical planner, see subsection below) 
3. Policy iteration or Value Iteration (Model-Based MDP)
4. Monte Carlo Tree Search or UCT (Model-Free MDP)
5. Reinforcement Learning â€“ classical, approximate or deep Q-learning (Model-Free MDP) 
6. Goal Recognition techniques (to infer intentions of opponents)
7. Game Theoretic Methods

## Comments per topic

## Files utilised (in addition to files provided by UC Berkeley)

***myTeam.py:*** the main file that implements agent set-up for the game, i.e., defines how they will behave and play the game. It also includes the approximate q-learning methodology for when the agents are training. /n
***usefulFunctions.py:*** contains helper methods and heuristic functions that are either made use of in *myTeam.py* or *featureExtraction.py*. /n
***featureExtraction.py:*** contains the majority of functions that are utilised to generate features within *myTeam.py*.
