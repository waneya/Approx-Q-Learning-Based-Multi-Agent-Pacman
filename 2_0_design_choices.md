1. Heuristic Search Algorithms (using general or pacman specific heuristic functions) 
2. Classsical Planning (PDDL and calling a classical planner, see subsection below) 
3. Policy iteration or Value Iteration (Model-Based MDP)
4. Monte Carlo Tree Search or UCT (Model-Free MDP)
5. Reinforcement Learning â€“ classical, approximate or deep Q-learning (Model-Free MDP) 
6. Goal Recognition techniques (to infer intentions of opponents)
7. Game Theoretic Methods
