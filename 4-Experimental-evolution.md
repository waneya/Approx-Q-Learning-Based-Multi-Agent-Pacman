In descending order. 
Problem: Pacman will return home after eating one-third food. In the problem below against staff team super and top, our team lost because Pacman collected enough food but it does not focus on returning home when few time is left and hence we lost.

Solution: WE have added a condition that when less than 200 unit of time is left, pacman will focus on returning home, in any case. After adding this condition we won against all staff-teams on 12th october at 8am session.

And consistently won against at least 3 staff teams (losing with either top or super at different times) through out the day.
