# Approach 2: Heuristic search algorithms

Heuristic search algorithms are those that attempt to estimate the cost of reaching a certain goal, given a partial step towards that goal. In the context of pacman this can be very helpful for two reasons:
1. Some search algorithms that provide optimal solutions (e.g. minimum spanning tree) are computationally expensive and unfeasible within the 1sec inter-turn computational time limit for each agent; and
2. There are some problems that must be tackled to improve agent performance, which are not directly informed to us by the game, and so, a heuristic is created to find a sufficient method of approaching that problem - and heuristic functions are utilised to contribute to the action decision-making process of the agents (after appropriate weighting).

1. Dead-ends
2. Distance to enemy when not visible
3. Problem:
Top and bottom 
5. Returning home when timer exceeds a certain point, or 1/3 of nearby food


There are certain features utilised within the approximate Q-learning approach that require costly search calculations to achieve a true value representation. And so, heuristic functions must be used to approximate values. However this must be done carefully as ill-defined (i.e. inadmissible) heuristics could lead to sub-optimal and adverse agent actions taken, as features would be estimated improperly.

### Motivation  

### The heuristics utilised or explored

***Maze distance:*** 

***Manhattan distance:***

***Noisy distance:***

The problem: when should an agent return home after eating food? A heuristic to minimise chance of getting eaten but also maximise score over the entire game

The mechanism: sqrt(height*width) map < maze distance to food 

Second mechanism: If there is a lot of food nearby (i.e. connected by 1 square), go back home after eating half of total food
