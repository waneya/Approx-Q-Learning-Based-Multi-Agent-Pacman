# Approach 1: Approximate Q-learning

### Motivation  
In order to eliminate the need for a large Q-table, and scale our solution, we implemented an approximate Q-function. Weights were derived using reinforcement Q-learning. Doing so enabled us to reasonably estimate Q(s,a) for states not previously seen, i.e. sampled.

Our initial thoughts were to use a neural network to approximate the Q-value (deep Q networks), however we deemed that the time frame of the project bounded our ability to fully implement this methodology. As an alternative, we opted for the aforementioned approach. 

### Application  
We implemented 22 features for our offensive, and 18 features for our defensive agent. Each feature was normalised to a binary [0,1] and was scaled by the learnt weight vector. Thus, each Q(s,a) was estimated by a linear sum of each feature and weight.

#### Reward Shaping
We recognised in earlier evolutions of our implementation that the reward would primarily occur late in the game, sometimes only at the terminal state. To expedite the learning process we modified the reward function. For our offensive agent, the reward was initially:
`FoodLeft/StartingFood + Score`

Whereas for the defensive, it was initially:
`AgentsEaten`.

These rewards allowed our agents to learn effectively from an initial implementation. However, ideal rewards for the offensive agent and defensive agents are: 
* positive score increments leading to positive rewards (ignoring negatives); and
* negative score increments leading to negative rewards (ignoring positives), respectively.

This would ensure that the agents are receiving rewards independently and are not influenced (i.e. misled) by the performance of the other agent, in the case of 1 offensive and 1 defensive agent. Additionally, focusing on the score ensures that agents do not follow misconstrued rewards such as those based on food. For example, if the reward for an offensive agent was eating food, then it could simply greedily eat all the food it can and then die to then repeat this process. This would be deemed an effective method for eating more food for an agent - with no real incentive to bring it back home, as this does not contribute to the reward, and it also drops the upper bound of food that can be eaten again.

#### Weight vector initialisation
Instead of initialising with a zero weight vector, we used judgement to create initialised values that we believed represented each features importance. In our case (but not to be confused with always), this allowed the reinforcement learning to reach optimisation significantly faster.

#### Training
``` python
# Hyperparameters
self.gamma = 0.99     
self.alpha = 0.15

# Epsilon greedy parameters
self.epsilonStart = 1.0 
self.epsilonMin = 0.01  
self.epsilonStep = (self.epsilonStart-self.epsilonMin)/self.trainEps
```
Training took place over the course of 1,000 games, in an offline setting.  Further to this initial training phase, the agent training was enabled during online tournament games to improve its competitiveness against other agents. 

### Advantages of this approach
* Significantly reduced the size of state space to [Features x Actions].
* Enabled up to apply heuristics (features) that we believed would lead to a successful agent.
* Faster convergence than a Deep-Q learning approach.

### Challenges experienced
* With this approach, we had to define features based on our understanding of the problem domain. This introduced a risk that we did not specify appropriate features and information about the state space, impacting the agents' ability to learn.
* Due to the sparsity of rewards, we had to introduce heuristics for each reward. Although close to `getScore`, our approximation is not an exact representation of the actual reward. As a result, the learning agent may learn sub-optimal moves. The trade-off is deemed appropriate given the significant time step between each action and reward.

### Possible improvements
*  A possible future implementation would combine the learning process amongst both agents. Currently, each agent acts (and learns) independently towards their specific objective - capture food or eat enemies. An improved solution would generalise the approach to a multi-agent solution in order for them to work as a team - including generalised reward structures for hybrid multi-agent behaviours.
* Given more time, deep Q-learning could be a viable way to maximise optimal behaviour amongst agents. However, this technique may always be non-viable due to its increasing complexity to obtain optimal convergence.
* Having access or generating a variety of enemy team agent behaviours would allow for greater generalisation for our agents' behaviour in the learning process. 

# Features

This is a summary of the features used, which are implemented in our final evolution or have been tested and discarded / re-adjusted. Further explanation of these features can be found in subsequent sections of the wiki.

### Offensive features

* Minimum distance from enemy
* Minimum distance to food
* Minimum distance to maximum food group 
* Dead end within n-steps
* Enemy scared indicator
* Food left in total in enemy territory
* Food currently holding
* Minimum distance to capsules in enemy territory
* Time left

### Defensive features

* In home territory
* Minimum distance from invading enemies; includes revealed enemies discussed in sections 3.2 & 3.3
* Minimum distance to food
* Minimum distance to the centre and other key locations, e.g. high 'food group' areas
* Minimum distance to capsules in home territory
* Is scared
* Food left in total in home territory
* Estimated food enemy is carrying
* Time left
