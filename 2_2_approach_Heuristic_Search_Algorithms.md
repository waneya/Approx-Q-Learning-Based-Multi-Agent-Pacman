# AI Method 2 - Heuristic search algorithms

There are certain features utilised within the approximate Q-learning approach that would require costly search calculations to achieve a true value representation. And so, heuristic functions must be used to approximate values. However this must be done carefully as ill-defined (i.e. unadmissible) heuristics in this pacman game could lead to sub-optimal and adverse agent actions taken, as features would be estimated improperly.

In the case of
